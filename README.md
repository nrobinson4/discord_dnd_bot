# discord_dnd_bot
Within this bot, I have wished to accomplish 3 main pillars. 
* Create an adventure for users.
* Develop a game to play with friends
* Challenge myself in an interesting way

## Making the bot work
# Download Dependencies
* The dependencies needed for the bot to run can be found in the package.json file.
* Install node.js from web at https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager
* You will need to run these commands at the least:
- npm init ( This is for the beginning of your project
- npm install discord.js
- npm install sequelize sqlite3
- npm install compromise ( For implementation of NLP )

# Config of project
* config.json file at root level is needed to work on current version of project.
* This config.json will require the token of your created discord bot, the id of your discord bot, and the server you wish for the bot to reside in's id.
